### üöÄ Overview

This section outlines the developer's journey and how to make a successful API call as quickly and efficiently as possible.

---

### üîÑ Onboarding

To begin integrating with our APIs, follow this quick-start flow:

#### Flow Overview

#### 1. üìù Register New Account

Developers must first register through the **Admin Portal** to obtain their API credentials.  
The required credentials include:

- **Username**
- **AccountID**
- **Password**

These are issued by the system administrator upon successful onboarding.

---

#### 2. üîê Authenticate to Obtain Access Token

Use the credentials to call the **Authentication API** and retrieve a valid **JWT access token**.  
This token will be used to authorize all subsequent API calls.

---

#### 3. üß© Service Onboarding Requirement

Before invoking the API flow, ensure that the target service is **predefined** or has been **onboarded** via the **Administration Tool**.

You can retrieve the configuration of a predefined service using one of the following methods:

Multiple services may utilize the same API interface but require distinct configurations. These configurations can be retrieved through:

- **[Service Catalog API](bill-payment-gateway/service-management/service-catalog.md)**  
  Intended for system-to-system integration, this API delivers machine-readable configuration data, including:
  - `serviceId`
  - Required parameters
  - Validation constraints (e.g., regular expressions)

- **[Product Catalog](bill-payment-gateway/service-management/product-catalog.md)**  
  Presents the same configuration details in a human-readable format, suitable for manual review and operational use.

> Both sources provide consistent core data. Select the appropriate option based on whether your integration is automated or user-facing.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Failure to complete this step will prevent successful execution of downstream APIs.

---

#### 4. üîß Execute the Service Flow

Once authenticated **and the service is onboarded**, developers can proceed to complete the full API flow. For example:

- **Inquiry API** ‚Äì To retrieve service-specific data (e.g., bills, balances).
- **Fees API** ‚Äì To calculate applicable transaction fees.
- **Payment API** ‚Äì To complete and confirm the transaction.

Optional steps like **Retry** or **Check Status** may be invoked after the payment, if needed.

---

This complete flow ensures a **secure**, **streamlined**, and **developer-friendly** onboarding experience.

!!! note "üîÅ Supported API Flows"
    To simplify your integration, we've streamlined all services into just **two core API flows**, making implementation **faster**, **more predictable**, and **easier to maintain**.

    Every service on our platform follows one of the following flows:

    - **Inquiry ‚Üí Fees ‚Üí Payment** ‚Äì for standard services like bill payments, vouchers, and installments  
    - **Initiate ‚Üí Confirm** ‚Äì for wallet-based services such as Vodafone Cash, Orange Money, and similar

    Used for the majority of services, including:

    - Bill payments  
    - Vouchers  
    - Top-ups  
    - Installments

    **Steps:**

    1. Inquiry using billing account  
    2. Fetch fees and validate  
    3. Proceed to payment

    Used for **cash-in / cash-out** wallet services, such as:

    - Vodafone Cash  
    - Orange Money  
    - Etisalat Cash  

    **Steps:**

    1. Initiate transaction
